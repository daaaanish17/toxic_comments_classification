# Toxic Comments Classification
A project developed in Python.

## Information

Python libraries that are used in this project are:
* Pandas
* nltk(Natural Language Toolkit)
* re(Regular Expression)

Using nltk (Natural Language Toolkit) library to perform these tasks:
* Tokenization (Tokenization is a way of separating a piece of text into smaller units called tokens.)
* Removing stopwords (eliminate words that are so commonly used that they carry very little useful information.)
* Stemming (Stemming is the process of reducing a word to its word stem that affixes to suffixes and prefixes or to the roots of words known as a lemma)


Converting comment_text column into vectors by using CountVectorizer().

Then train our machine learning model(Multinomial Naive Bayes algorithm).
